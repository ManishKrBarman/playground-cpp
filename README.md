# C++ Playground

This repository is a structured playground to practice and explore various C++ concepts, patterns, and problem-solving techniques.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ✅ **C++ Workflow** — Compilation process from source to executable (`00_workflow/`)
- ✅ **Basic I/O Operations** — Hello World with `iostream` (`01_hello/`)
- ✅ **Variables & Data Types** — Introduction to variables (`02_variables/`)
- ✅ **Functions** — Function declaration, definition, and parameters (`03_functions/`)
- ✅ **Header Files** — Code organization and modular programming (`04_header_files/`)
- ✅ **Conditions & Branches** — If-else, ternary, switch statements (`05_conditions_branches/`)
- ✅ **Loops** — For, while, do-while, range-based loops (`06_loops/`)
- ✅ **Control Flow** — Break, continue, return, exception handling (`07_control_flow/`)
- ✅ **Pointers** — Memory addresses, dynamic allocation, pointer arithmetic (`08_pointers/`)
- ✅ **References** — Aliasing, pass-by-reference, const references (`09_references/`)
- ✅ **Classes** — Object-oriented programming, constructors, destructors (`10_classes/`)
- ✅ **Structs** — Data structures, member functions, initialization (`11_structs/`)
- ✅ **Static** — Static variables, static functions, storage classes (`12_static/`)
- 🔄 **More topics coming soon...**

## ⚙️ Compile & Run a C++ File
```cmd
g++ file.cpp -o output.exe    # Compiles and creates output.exe

output.exe                    # Executes the program (Windows)
```

### 📝 Example with a project:
```cmd
cd 00_workflow
g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
main.exe
```
