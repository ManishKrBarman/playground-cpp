# C++ Playground

This repository is a structured playground to practice and explore various C++ concepts, patterns, and problem-solving techniques.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ✅ **C++ Workflow** — Compilation process from source to executable (`00_workflow/`)
- ✅ **Basic I/O Operations** — Hello World with `iostream` (`01_hello/`)
- ✅ **Variables & Data Types** — Introduction to variables (`02_variables/`)
- 🔄 **More topics coming soon...**

## 💡 Purpose

- 🎯 Solidifying foundational C++ concepts
- 🧠 Practicing problem-solving and clean code
- 📝 Building ready-to-copy snippets for future use
- 📖 Creating a professional reference for future projects

## ⚙️ Compile & Run a C++ File
```cmd
g++ file.cpp -o output.exe    # Compiles and creates output.exe

output.exe                    # Executes the program (Windows)
```

### 📝 Example with a project:
```cmd
cd 00_workflow
g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
main.exe
```
